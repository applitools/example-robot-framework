### applitools.yaml 1.2

# This config file specifies how to run visual tests with Applitools.
# It applies to all tests in this project.

# To connect visual test results to your account,
# you must set the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to your Applitools API key.
# To find it: https://applitools.com/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment.html
# If you don't explicitly set the API key here,
# then the SDK will automatically read the `APPLITOOLS_API_KEY` environment variable to fetch it.
# api_key: YOUR_API_KEY

# Propagate Eyes results to robot `report.html`.
propagate_eyes_test_results: true

# A batch is the collection of visual checkpoints for a test suite.
# Batches are displayed in the Eyes Test Manager, so use meaningful names.

  name: "Example: Robot Framework"

# The name of the app under test.
# All tests for the same app should share the same app name.
# Set this name wisely: Applitools features rely on a shared app name across tests.
