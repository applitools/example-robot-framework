# Applitools Example: Robot Framework with the Ultrafast Grid

This is the example project for the [Robot Framework tutorial](https://applitools.com/tutorials/quickstart/web/robot-framework).
It shows how to start automating visual tests
with [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/platform/eyes/)
and the [Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/platform/ultrafast-grid/)
using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/).

It uses:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the programming language platform
* [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) as the core test framework
* [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) for browser automation underneath Robot Framework
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/) as the local browser for testing
* [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) for dependency management
* [Applitools Eyes](https://applitools.com/platform/eyes/) for visual testing
* [Applitools Ultrafast Grid](https://applitools.com/platform/ultrafast-grid/) for cross-browser execution

To run this example project, you'll need:

1. An [Applitools account](https://auth.applitools.com/users/register), which you can register for free
2. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) version 3.6 or higher
3. A good editor with Robot Framework support like [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robocorp.robotframework-lsp)
4. An up-to-date version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/downloads/)
5. A corresponding version of [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

To install dependencies, run:
